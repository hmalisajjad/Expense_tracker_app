Features
**React.js:** The app is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture that enables the creation of reusable UI components.

**Components and Props:** The app utilizes components and props to create modular and reusable pieces of UI. This allows for better organization and maintainability of the code.

**Dynamic Data Binding:** The app implements dynamic data binding to ensure that the UI is automatically updated when the underlying data changes. This provides a seamless and responsive user experience.

**User Events and State Management:** User events are handled using React's event system, and state management is employed to create interactive and responsive applications. This enables the app to respond to user interactions in real-time.

**React Hooks:** The app extensively utilizes React Hooks, which are a set of functions that enable state management and other features in functional components. It covers both working with built-in Hooks and building custom Hooks.

**Understand React Internals:** The app offers a detailed look into how React works under the hood. It provides insights into React's virtual DOM, reconciliation algorithm, and component lifecycle.

**Lists and Conditional Rendering:** Detailed explanations are provided on how to work with lists and conditional content in React. This allows for dynamic rendering of elements based on certain conditions or iterating over arrays of data.

**Debugging React Apps:** The app covers techniques and tools for debugging React applications. It helps developers identify and fix issues, ensuring smooth operation of the app.
